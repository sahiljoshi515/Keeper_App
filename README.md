# Keeper_App

- This app is similar to Google Keep. I have used Node.js and MongoDB for the backend and React.js for the frontend.
- I have deployed this app on Heroku.
- There are a few bugs that I need to fix. If you're interested in collaborating and making it stand for public facing do message!
